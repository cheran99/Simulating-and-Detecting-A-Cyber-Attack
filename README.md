# Simulating-and-Detecting-A-Cyber-Attack

## Introduction

### Overview

In this digital world, it is critical to detect and analyse cyber threats so that appropriate responsive actions can be taken to mitigate them. This project simulates real-world cyber attacks in a virtual environment. The penetration testing tools used in this project are Metasploit and Burp Suite, while Nessus is used for vulnerability scanning, Wireshark is used for traffic analysis, and Splunk is used for log monitoring. A Kali Linux VM will be used as the attacker's environment while the Ubuntu VM will be used as the target system. With this in mind, various attacks will be conducted to observe and analyse their impact and the steps taken to detect, analyse, and mitigate these attacks will be showcased. 

### Objectives

- Simulate cyber attacks using Metasploit and Burp Suite
- Capture and analyse network traffic using Wireshark
- Utilise Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities in the target system
- Monitor and analyse logs using Splunk
- Implement threat detection and response
