# Simulating-and-Detecting-A-Cyber-Attack

## Introduction

### Overview

In this digital world, it is critical to detect and analyse cyber threats so that appropriate responsive actions can be taken to mitigate them. This project simulates real-world cyber attacks in a virtual environment. The penetration testing tools used in this project are Metasploit and Burp Suite, while Nessus is used for vulnerability scanning, Wireshark is used for traffic analysis, and Splunk is used for log monitoring. A Kali Linux VM will be used as the attacker's environment while the Ubuntu VM will be used as the target system. With this in mind, various attacks will be conducted to observe and analyse their impact and the steps taken to detect, analyse, and mitigate these attacks will be showcased. 

### Objectives

- Simulate cyber attacks using Metasploit and Burp Suite
- Capture and analyse network traffic using Wireshark
- Utilise Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities in the target system
- Monitor and analyse logs using Splunk
- Implement threat detection and response

## Tools Used 

- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- Nessus
- Wireshark
- Splunk
- Kali Linux VM (attack machine)
- Ubuntu VM (target machine)

## Project Setup 

### Prerequisites 
- Kali Linux VM - for running Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nessus

     `sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.8.3-debian10_amd64.deb`
   - Start Nessus using the following command:

     `sudo systemctl start nessusd`
   - To check if it is running, run the following command:

     `sudo systemctl status nessusd`
   - Open Nessus in the browser using the following link:

     `https://localhost:8834`
   - This will give you a warning. Accept the risk and continue.
   - You will then be directed to the Nessus page:
